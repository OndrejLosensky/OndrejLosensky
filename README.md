## ` ðŸ’¬ About me `
I recently graduated from Technical High School of Mechanical Engineering. My main focus is on creating dynamic web projects with Next.js and TypeScript. 
With a strong passion for graphic design, I ensure all my projects have a professional and polished appearance by leveraging TailwindCSS for sleek and modern styling. 

Dont forget to check my web portfolio which is more detailed [www.losensky.tech](https://www.losensky.tech)

I am currently open to new opportunities and job offers. Feel free to reach out to me via email.

Also check out my custom-made VSCode theme. [here](https://github.com/OndrejLosensky/losiks-theme). You can download it and use it!

Recently I started to learn game dev with Godot engine.
