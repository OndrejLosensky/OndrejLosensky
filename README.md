## ðŸ’¬ About me
In spring 2024, I'll be graduating high school. I'm fluent in JavaScript and TypeScript, specializing in React.js for web development. Python scripting is my go-to for streamlining tasks and boosting productivity.

With a passion for graphic design, I ensure all my projects look top-notch, utilizing TailwindCSS for sleek styling. You can find my web projects hosted on Netlify.com.

Open to new opportunities and jobs, feel free to reach out via email.

  I am passionate about creating apps that make me learn new technologies, languages, styles or anything I'll get expirience from. You can also find some of my templates that i have created for anything I thought **(Notion, Wordpress, Shopify store)**, they are somewhere sold on gumroad or any other global system to sell digital products.

  Lower in this readme you can find technologies and tools that I am using, planning to use or even tried them.
