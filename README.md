## ðŸ’¬ About me
I am still in High School graduating Spring 2024. Mostly I am working with JavaScript or TypeScript in React.js, but I also really love to create Python scripts that speed up my work or make it easier for me. Also I really love Graphics Design so I try to make everything look good. For mostly all my styling I use TailwindCSS. All projects that can be uploaded on web are hosted on Netlify.com 

You can always contact me on my e-mail. I am opened to new **opportunities & jobs**

  I am passionate about creating apps that make me learn new technologies, languages, styles or anything I'll get expirience from. You can also find some of my templates that i have created for anything I thought **(Notion, Wordpress, Shopify store)**, they are somewhere sold on gumroad or any other global system to sell digital products.

  Lower in this readme you can find technologies and tools that I am using, planning to use or even tried them.
