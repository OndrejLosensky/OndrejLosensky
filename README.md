# Hello there! 👋 

I'm [Ondřej](https://losensky.tech), a software developer based in Prague, Czech Republic 📍🇨🇿


I like to create modern applications. My most used framework is Next.js with TypeScript. I also specialize in graphics design to make everything look sleek. 

I really love to learn new technolgies, libraries, design concepts and many more...

I currently work mostly with TypeScript, but I am trying to learn Java now. 

My biggest goal is to create fully functional **Content Management System** for portfolio websites and blog apps ( Something like WordPress but actually good)
